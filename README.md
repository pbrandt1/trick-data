# trick-data

A module for working with data output from NASA's [Trick](https://github.com/nasa/trick) simulation suite.

ISC-licensed and with zero runtime dependencies. There are development dependencies which are for running regression tests.

at this point i'm not sure what the functionality will be. post-processsing obviously, but i also would like to get live streaming during simulation runs going.
